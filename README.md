To create a heading, add hash symbol signs in front of a word or phrase. The number of number signs you use should correspond to the heading level. Here are examples: 
# TestProject for Heading level 1 
## TestProject for Heading level 2
### TestProject for Heading level 3
#### TestProject for Heading level 4
##### TestProject for Heading level 5


<p>To bold text, add two asterisks or underscores before and after a word or phrase. To bold the middle of a word for emphasis, add two asterisks without spaces around the letters.</p>

I see **cats**.

Be**lie**ver


To italicize text, add one asterisk or underscore before and after a word or phrase. To italicize the middle of a word for emphasis, add one asterisk without spaces around the letters.
